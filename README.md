One billion total supply. 5% transfer fee - 2% to staking pool, 2% lottery pool, 1% burnt.

Unique LP functionality that raises BNB to be locked forever into the HSKI liquidity pool. Purchase lottery tickets with BNB, which is swapped for HSKI, and locked forever into the liquidity pool. This avoids the issue other automatic LP tokens have of taking BNB out of the pool, and as a result decreasing the price of the token.

Users can lock their HSKI into the staking pool for a fixed duration, they then receive a share of all transfer fees.
